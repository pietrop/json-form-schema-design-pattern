# Json Form Schema (Design) Pattern 


## TODO(s)

- [ ] Add [TypeScript](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/typescript) to storybook
- [ ] Extend the list of form fields (maybe use [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com))
- [x] change stories in storybook to use MDX 
- [x] Github pages deploy and link to build of storybook
- [ ] rename `title` and `label` to match?
- [x] add ptoptypes to `FormFieldFactory`
- [x] add ptoptypes to `FormFieldFactory` with props for `fieldComponents`
- [x] rename `FormField` to `FormFieldFactory`?
- [ ] make sure error clears out after initial validation 
- [x] input implement `format`? eg via:
- [ ] consistency between error handled by html element (via format) and external validation? 
- [x] try storybook story with initial form data

## TODO for the pattern
- [ ] Should it rely  a little more on the HTML input element validation, or should it all be in JS (validation function)? 
- [ ] Same for the HTML input element, require attribute, should it rely on that or use the js (validation function)?


## Feedback
Currently looking for feedback on two main areas
1. clarity of the docs explanation
2. what's lacking or can be improved in the POC react implementation (for demonstration porposes)
