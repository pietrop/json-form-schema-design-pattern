# `WepbackPluginJsDocToMdx`

A custom webpack plugin to generate mdx pages from jsdoc.

```js
const WepbackPluginJsDocToMdx = require("./webpack-plugin-jsdoc-to-mdx/index.js");
```
You can add it to your wepack config, and you can specify a list of files to include 
```js
 config.plugins.push(new WepbackPluginJsDocToMdx({
      files:[
        {
          metaTitle: "Components/Player/Player Class",
          inputFilePath: "src/Factory/presets/MediaPlayer/Player/index.js",
          outpuFilePath: "src/Factory/presets/MediaPlayer/Player/Player.autogenerated.stories.mdx"
        },
    // ...
      ]
```
You can also use a `glob`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) pattern for `inputFilePath`. Eg if you want to include all the [react custom hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) in your project.
In which case `outpuFilePath` will be determined by how glob resolves input file path. And either use the file name (if the file name is not `index`) or the folder name.



For this glob usage, the `metaTitle` simply provides the storybook path where you'd like the component to be displayed. 
```js
 config.plugins.push(new WepbackPluginJsDocToMdx({
      files:[
       // ...
        {
          metaTitle: `Components/UI Components/hooks/`,
          inputFilePath: `src/ui-components/hooks/*/index.js`
        },
        // ...
      ]
```




Files generated by the plugin will have the postfix `.autogenerated.stories.mdx`.
```js
const {AUTOGENERATED_MDX_STORIES_POSTFIX} = require("./webpack-plugin-jsdoc-to-mdx/index.js");
```

```js
config.plugins.push(new WepbackPluginJsDocToMdx({
    files:[
    {
        metaTitle: "Components/Player/Player Class",
        inputFilePath: "src/Factory/presets/MediaPlayer/Player/index.js",
        outpuFilePath: `src/Factory/presets/MediaPlayer/Player/Player${AUTOGENERATED_MDX_STORIES_POSTFIX}`
    },
    // ...
```

There's a typo in outPutFile - ~outpuFilePath~
